        <p>Overview<br><br>The course will be taught via Skype by a Palestinian tutor living in Gaza. Its aims are to provide students with a thorough introduction to the language, covering essential working vocabulary and basic grammatical constructions. Being taught from Gaza, you will be learning Arabic within the context of the Palestinian struggle for freedom, forging links which we hope will further the internationalist solidarity movement. The course is open to beginners or intermediate Arabic speakers. No prior knowledge of Arabic is required to take this course. The Skype sessions have been planned to be run on a one to one basis, but if you would prefer to learn with a friend please let us know.<br><br>What is the course?<br><br>The course will teach Palestinian (Levantine) Arabic. If you want to learn Modern Standard Arabic, we believe it is best to start with the spoken dialect first and then move onto Modern Standard, in order to be able to speak directly with people. The course runs for a minimum of 10 sessions and each class lasts for an hour and a half. We can do lessons weekly, fortnightly or more regularly. It’s really up to you!<br><br>Who will teach the course?<br><br>The courses are coordinated by Karama, is a passionate and experienced teacher living in Gaza. She has tutored international NGO workers for a number of years. The lessons will be taught by either Karama, or an excellent Palestinian tutor, personally trained by her to give engaging and clear Skype lessons.<br><br>How much is each lesson? <br><br>LLC charges prices on a pay what you can afford basis. As a guide for how much you should be paying, we have devised a simple set of questions that take into account your income and wealth and give you a suggested price. We call this the wealth test.  For whatever reason if you think this price is unfair, we can offer you a breakeven price which allows us to recuperate our costs and keep the organisation running. <br><br>Almost all of this money goes on wages for our tutors, who are all paid the Living Wage of £12.70 per hour. We do this to make an important political point: that people everywhere should be paid an equal global wage. <br><br>The first lesson is a refundable taster session, so if you don’t like it, you can get your money back. <br><br>When will the course start? <br><br>You can start the course at a time that suits you. Just follow the sign up link below, complete the wealth test, and sign you up for your first lesson. <br><br>Why Gaza? <br><br>The unemployment ate in Gaza is 44%. For young people, it is over 60%. We want to link excellent teachers in Gaza to students across the world, so that we can learn about Palestine and its language while providing a decent income for people who need it. <br><br>Student Statement - Ben <br><br>“Before signing up to the course, I was concerned that doing lessons over Skype might be awkward. But in reality it was exactly the opposite. The quality of the calls were really clear and my teacher was so engaging (with a great sense of humour). It’s amazing to learn directly from somebody who is living in Gaza. If you want to learn Arabic, I would 100% recommend it.”
